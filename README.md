# HowAreYou: Coordinating Home Visits for At-Risk Elderly

This project was developed as part of Build for Good 2024. Our team created an application designed to coordinate home visits for socially isolated, at-risk elderly individuals. The platform helps track visits across different organizations, aiming to address the critical issue of unnoticed deaths among the elderly by ensuring continuity of care and promoting meaningful interactions with elderly residents.

## Project Overview

**HowAreYou** is a web-based platform that connects staff and volunteers across various organizations to track home visits to elderly individuals who are at risk of social isolation. The system fosters a collaborative approach to elderly care by:

- Tracking home visits to ensure regular check-ins with at-risk elderly individuals.
- Facilitating continuity of care across organizations, reducing the risk of unnoticed deaths.
- Enabling staff to access detailed visit histories for more meaningful and consistent interactions.
- Promoting collaboration between organizations, improving overall elderly care in the community.

## Features

### 1. **Visit Tracking**
The app tracks home visits to elderly individuals, ensuring that staff and volunteers from different organizations can log visits and view the history of past interactions. This feature helps ensure continuity of care and identifies any gaps in service.

### 2. **Visit History**
The platform allows staff to access a detailed history of all previous visits, including notes on the elderly resident's well-being. This ensures that each visit is meaningful and personalized, fostering stronger relationships between staff and elderly residents.

### 3. **Collaborative Care**
Organizations can collaborate more effectively by sharing visit data, ensuring that elderly residents receive regular care even if staff or volunteers from one organization are unavailable.

### 4. **Continuity of Care**
The app addresses the critical issue of unnoticed deaths among socially isolated elderly by providing continuous care through a coordinated network of organizations. This system reduces the likelihood of elderly residents being left unattended for long periods.
